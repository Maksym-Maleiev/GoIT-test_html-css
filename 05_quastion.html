        The psd layout has an area called canvas. This is the area in which the designer can do
        something draw, and the program will not allow drawing outside this area. canvas width is
        not specific screen width, but the maximum. Those. the actual screen may be larger or
        smaller - it doesn't matter. In layout, this is still the width of the body, which we will
        not set. Because the width body specifies the operating system and browser.
